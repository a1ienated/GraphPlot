# GraphPlot
Multithreaded random number graphing application

#### It is necessary to implement starting, pausing and stopping an individual stream by pressing the corresponding keys. Transfer an array of randomly generated values ​​(xi; yi) from the stream and display them on the graph.
Control Keys:  
__start__ - an array of generated values ​​begins to be displayed on the chart;  
__pause__ - a set of generated values ​​is fixed on the graphic scene, the stream “pauses”, when you press __start__ again, generation and display of new values ​​from the stream continues;  
__stop__ - clears the graphic scene and finishes the flow.
